# Global-Data-Science-Salaries-Dashboard
This Salary Insights Dashboard analyzes salary distribution by experience, job title, employment type, and location. It shows full-time and senior roles offer higher pay, most companies are medium-sized, and the US has the highest employee count. A world map highlights salary by country, and a table compares salaries by job title.

An Overview of the Dashboard provided: This Salary Insights Dashboard provides a detailed analysis of salary distribution based on experience level, job title, employment type, and location. I designed this dashboard in Tableau, starting with a scatter plot displaying average salaries by experience level and employment type, revealing that full-time roles generally offer higher salaries. A donut chart shows that most companies are medium-sized, and the experience level distribution highlights that senior-level positions dominate, followed by intermediate roles. The world map visualizes average salary by country, with the United States having the highest number of employees. A bar chart lists the top 10 employee residence countries, with the US leading significantly. I also included a table showing average salaries by job title and experience level, providing a clear comparison across roles. The dashboard offers a clear view of how experience, job type, and location impact salary, making it a valuable tool for understanding global salary trends. The main insight from this Salary Insights Dashboard is that salary is significantly influenced by experience level and employment type, with full-time and senior-level roles offering the highest pay. The majority of companies are medium-sized, and the United States has the highest number of employees, suggesting it is a major hub for these roles. Additionally, most high-paying jobs are concentrated in countries like the US, UK, and Canada.
